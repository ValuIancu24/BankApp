🔐 Authentication Flow

User registers or logs in through the frontend
Backend validates credentials and issues a JWT token
Token is stored in local storage and included in the Authorization header
Backend middleware validates the token for protected routes
Token expiration triggers automatic logout

💰 Transaction Processing
Transactions follow this workflow:

User initiates a transaction (transfer, deposit, withdrawal, bill payment)
Backend validates the transaction (sufficient funds, limits, etc.)
Transaction is recorded in the database
Account balances are updated
Currency conversion is applied if necessary
Confirmation is sent to the user
